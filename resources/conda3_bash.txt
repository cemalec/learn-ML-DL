jyoon@Asus-S510:~$ python

Python 3.6.5 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Apr 29 2018, 16:14:56)
[GCC 7.2.0] on linux
>>> import os
>>> os
<module 'os' from '/mnt/c/python/conda3linux/lib/python3.6/os.py'>

### Linux commands 
File names case sensitive, folder names case sensitive.

mv  (rename file as well as move file to new path)
$home  (goes to default directory, $home/jyoon )
/mnt/c/python  (file structure on Windows)
cd /  (goto root)
rm file.txt (remove or delete file.  No undelete)

echo 'hello testing' > test.txt  (puts text into new file "test.txt")
> test2.txt  (creates new file "test2.txt")
cat > test3.txt  (concatenate/append to file. Control+d to save & exit)
echo test2.txt  (prints content of text file to screen)

nano  (text editor built-in)
nano newfile.txt  (opens newfile)
Control+s  (save)
Control+x  (exit)

### cat command
Create a text file called foo.txt, type:

cat > foo.txt  (single right bracket)
This is a test.

(Control + d to save and exit)

Create another file, bar.txt

echo 'For desktop usage I prefer Apple OS X unix operating systems.' > bar.txt

Display both files
cat foo.txt  (no right bracket)
cat bar.txt
