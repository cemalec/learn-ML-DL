Biography
I came to Janelia in 2013 after spending six years at Johns Hopkins studying electrical engineering. I became interested in processing image data after working with my undergraduate advisor at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a Computer Scientist at Janelia, where I focus on image analysis and registration. When I am not in the Saalfeld Lab, I can be found cooking or playing the drums.
