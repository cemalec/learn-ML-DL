# learn-ML-DL
My adventure in learning Python machine learning and deep learning.

I am learning Python Machine Learning and Deep Learning.  My goal is to document my progress on a GitHub repo.  

**Main Classes:**  
 * Stanford CS231n Spring 2019, Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition  
      http://cs231n.stanford.edu/  
 * Coursera.org, deeplearning.ai class 4, Convolutional Neural Networks  
      https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning  
 * Fast.ai, Practical Deep Learning for Coders  
      https://course.fast.ai/  
    
**Main Books:**  
 * Jake VanderPlas, Python Data Science Handbook (c 2017)  
 * Gareth James et. al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (c 2013)  
 * Francois Chollet, Deep Learning with Python (c 2018)  

Folder structure will be either by topic or by class name.  
  
I am also a member of a Meetup group in Sterling, Virginia that are learning Stanford CS231n together.
